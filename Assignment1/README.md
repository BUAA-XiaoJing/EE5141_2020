# Assignment 1

This assignment focuses on the use of Jakes' method and Clarke-Gans method to simulate a Rayleigh waveform and characterize the extent of fade using LCR and average fade duration.

## Contents

- ```ClarkeGans.mlx```: a MATLAB live script that uses the Clarke and Gans method to simulate the Rayleigh waveform for different doppler shift frequencies and studies the variation of LCR and average fade duration with the normalized threshold level. A comparison with the theoretical values is also performed.
- ```Jakes_model.mlx```: a MATLAB live script that uses the Jakes' method to simulate the Rayleigh waveform for different doppler shift frequencies and studies the variation of LCR and average fade duration with the normalized threshold level. A comparison with the theoretical values is also performed. The model is further extended to Ricean fading.
- ```problem1_ca1.m```: a MATLAB script version of Jakes_model.mlx.
- ```problem2_ca1.m```: a MATLAB script version of ClarkeGans.mlx.
